		  A vegetable garden without peas is somehow incomplete. Planting pea requires a little more effort, but don’t miss it out!<br>
Peas are one of the basic types of vegetables known in every corner of the world. Interesting looks and sweet taste is a favorite among children. While completely young, it is tempting to eat raw, although it may cause stomach upset.<br>
Furthermore, peas do not stay fresh long after harvest, so enjoy them while you can!</p><br>
		  <div class="w3-container">
		    <h2>Some basics...</h2>
		    <p class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue-gray">Pea is grown as a cool-season vegetable crop. The <i class="basics">most important</i> thing you should consider is the pea must be planted as <i class="basics">early as possible</i>, in late February to mid-March.<br> It takes about 60 to <i class="basics">70 days</i> from planting to maturity, meaning the fresh sweet grains are coming to your table about mid-May!<br><br> Peas have both low-growing and vining cultivars. The vining cultivars can climb up to <i class="basics">2 m</i> high. It is necessary to prepare support for such varieties. This <i class="basics">support</i> can be made of branches, which is an old traditional way, or nowadays a metal fence or a framed net. <br>I plant lower varieties of peas in dense plantings, which allows two neighbor rows to lean against each other as some measure of mutual support.<br><br>

Like any other vegetable, peas are attacked by various <i class="basics">pests and diseases.</i> The most common is the pea weevil, which needs to be treated with an appropriate <i class="basics">insecticide.</i> Use insecticides and pesticides as <i class="basics">little as possible</i>, especially if the treated vegetables are ripening soon. Perform the treatment just before the peas bloom, at the latest until the appearance of small pods sizes about 1-2 cm.<br><br> Be prepared for picking <i class="basics">peapods</i> about two weeks after the first flower, because they <i class="basics">grow pretty fast</i>!

	<p class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-brown">There are <i class="basics">many varieties</i> of peas. My family is not a fan of peas with edible pods, so-called sugar peas. I plant "ordinary" peas, having sweet grains.<br><br><i class="basics">Saving seeds</i> to plant for the next season from your harvest is very beneficial, too! Simply leave a couple of finest pods on the bush to get mature. <i class="basics">Mature pods</i> for seeds are ready to harvest as soon as they <i class="basics">turn brown</i> on the bush and become dry. The peas may simply be removed from their shell by hand. Remove all the dirt and debris from dry seeds and store them in a cool, dark and dry place for the next season.<br><br>Processing, finishing, treatment against pests that would like to bite sweet seeds, and thus reduce the yield, are all advantages of seeds when prepared by professionals.<br><br>Until you <i class="basics">gain enough knowledge</i> and experience with saving your own seeds, the best solution, for now, is to <i class="basics">buy them</i>.</p>

		    <p class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-lime">Peas, as same as onion, are one of the first crops we plant in spring. Plant peas in late February or <i class="basics">early March</i>, meaning as soon as the ground can be worked!<br> If the snow falls after that, don’t worry! Your peas will be just fine!<br><br>It’s useful to mention there are sorts of peas you <i class="basics">can plant in fall</i>, too. This is a great practice for the reason you’ll harvest a little earlier, as it will spare you time for planting other vegetables in spring. But keep in mind that <i class="basics">fall plantings</i> are typically <i class="basics">not as productive</i> as spring-grown vegetables, although some experts claim otherwise. <br><br>
If planting in fall the right timing would be late October or early November.
Young pea plants shouldn’t enter winter too big. At an earlier stage of development, low temperatures won’t damage them a bit!
Of course, consider fall planting only if you live in the warmer <i title="The northern temperate zone is found between the 66.50 North and 23.50 North latitudes" class="w3-blue-gray">northern temperate zone.</i><br><br>Plant peas in rows about 50cm apart, and seeds 3-5cm apart. My practice is to make a bit <i class="basics">deeper rows</i> to prevent birds to dig up the sweet seed!<br>
The pea plant is attractive to eat by various inhabitants of the field, such as mice, pheasants, crows, and rabbits. since my garden is right in the field, to me this is a big problem. To prevent pests from eating peas, our grandparents made <i class="basics">scarecrows</i> that somewhat resembled humans and drove away unwanted visitors.<br> As times change and technology advances, I used a slightly more modern way to solve this problem, as making scarecrows didn't go very well for me. I used a few old sticks and some rope on which I ordered my daughter's <i class="basics">old CDs</i> (burned with Penguins of Madagascar, Tarzan, Tom, and Jerry - all the best cartoons!). The effect was great! The reflection of the CDs on the sun as the breeze swayed them really drove away the little thieves!<br><br>
Choose a <i class="basics">sunny location</i> for planting. Peas can grow in part-shade but they won’t be as sweet as those grown in full sun!<br>
On the other hand, peas are best grown in <i class="basics">lower temperatures</i>(below 21°C).
If temperatures go higher, your peas will stop growing and producing pods. That’s why the best timing for planting is the first half of March. This way harvesting will happen in the mid of May.

		    <p class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-deep-orange">Pea is ready to pick when the <i class="basics">pods have swelled</i> and are nearly cylindrical shape. To get the best quality peas, pods should be picked at least <i class="basics">2-3 times a week</i>. This way you get youngest grains, soft, middle-size and sweet. The harvesting period lasts for about <i class="basics">4 weeks</i>. It takes quite a bit of effort for this but the taste of garden-grown peas is nothing like what you find in grocery stores! When you pick peas always <i class="basics">use two hands</i>, to avoid damaging the plant!<br> The best timing for harvesting is morning, after the dew has dried and the pea-bushes are still fresh.

Peas don’t last long, a <i class="basics">day or two in the refrigerator</i>. The best way to store it is by <i class="basics">freezing</i> them. This way you’ll enjoy its taste during the year-round!
